<h1>About!</h1>

Formed in 2005, Forever Dead are a five piece rock and roll brotherhood fused with fierce fem-vox. Formerly dabbling in the psychobilly genre, Forever Dead have since settled into their punk rock roots. Playing a rowdy, no bull shit style.

Leading the pack with her fierce vocal style is Chelsea Heart. Backed up by the heavy hitting trifecta that is the Gratz brothers. Jorge Gratzo (upright, electric bass and backup vocals), El Gratzo (guitar and backup vocals) and Tylore T. Destroyer (drums).  Adding a touch of insanity to the groups sound is Mrac Viherkoski, who left the band and rejoined.

Over the course of fifteen years the intuitive and enthusiastic musicians continue to evolve with each album, and 2021’s Pretending We’re Surviving shows a fierce talent and confident ability that wasn’t as obvious on 2015’s EpicDemic, 2008’s Not Quite Dead Yet and 2011’s Forever Dead. Praised by local media and applauded by online punk sites, Forever Dead take pride in their DIY ethics, releasing their own albums, and producing all necessary artwork, posters, and merch. This hardworking group has been around the block and gets the job done.

This is more than just a band to the four members. Forever Dead is also family, and nothing is closer than blood-on-blood. Through good times and bad, these hometown heroes provide an outlet for both happiness and frustration, and fans are along for the crazy ride.
