Straight out of the gate, “Pretending We’re Surviving”,  packs a potent punch of punk rock rowdiness and refuses to let up.  Written over the course of ten years and recorded in 6 days. “Pretending We’re Surviving”, boasts 18 tracks laced with tasty licks and hella good kicks! In classic punk and hardcore manor the album stabs at topics like attempted sobriety, problematic society, iffy politics, psychological space problems, hypothetical lab experiments and haunted dentures.

“Pretending We’re Surviving”, is the fourth release by Canadian punk band Forever Dead! And celebrates 15 years as a band.

Grab a beverage, turn it up and enjoy the ride.
