Northwestern Ontario Punk rock stalwarts Forever Dead! are keeping the torch lit and blazing it up with the new EP “Here’s To Long Drawn-Out Terrible Endings”.

This boisterous endeavor is Forever Dead's fifth release and boasts seven exuberant anthems for misfits and the unruly.  Like a bat flying at you in a smoke filled room, this joint hits big with the hardcore stoner punk swooning of “Black Mamba”. Maintaining a steadfast ambiance along the way, as abrupt and chaotic  as a flash tumult strikes by the end the haze clears and the clambering dissipates. Leaving this escapade in a state of existentialism, pondering “New One-Order”.
